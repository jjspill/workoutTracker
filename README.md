# About the Project

This application makes tracking workouts and diet more streamlined and accessible rather than using a simple note.

## Key Features

- **User Profile**: Users can create their profiles to personalize the experience and track their progress over time.
- **Exercise Tracking**: Detailed exercise tracking allows users to log their workouts and view their progress displayed in easy-to-read charts.
- **Meal Logging**: A comprehensive meal logging system helps users track their nutrition and understand their dietary habits.
- **Workout Streaks**: Encourages consistency in users' fitness journey by tracking workout streaks.
- **Weight and Max Lifts Tracking**: Users can keep track of their weight and max lifts over time, visually represented with interactive charts.

## Tech Stack

This web app uses a mix of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for frontend development. The site's dynamic elements, such as interactive charts, are powered by the Chart.js library. For seamless DOM manipulation and event handling, I've used jQuery.
